		My name is Mike Lyons, and I am a Software Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a dedicated and brilliant programmer who enjoys applying his programing knowledge to solve a variety of problems. I am currently looking for Co-ops or Internships as a software engineer.
		<br/><br/>
		So far in my career I have worked with many different programming languages, and have learned to adapt quickly to new developing enviroments and strategies. My main interests are in artificial intelligence and it's application to making human day to day life easier. I am, however, generally willing to program anything that seems fun or chalenging.<br/>

				During high school a large part of my inspiration has come from the FIRST Robotics program. My team was the Powerhawks FRC team 1111. I was the head of the programming team my senior year, and a large part of creating the website for the team. FIRST robotics is an amazing program that allows for high school kids to develop an idea of what it is like to build and deploy a product in a real world setting under a real world deadline.
